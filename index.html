                        I worked as a real-time analsyt for the Citibank collections department, overseeing up to four lines of business daily and trained in over ten lines of business.

I was a SME in several WFM tools, such as NICE IEX, Aspect eWFM, RTR, RTA and UCC.

                    <p>
                        In 2023, our group onboarded the biggest line of business to be handled by the collections dialer teams. It included setting up and skilling over 200 agents, making 30+ skilling templates, all set up in the dialer tool in one day, along with updating a playbook.
                        I took charge of setting up the agents in the dialer. I found 3 teammates to assist, split up the list of agents by workgroup, showed everyone shortcuts on how to get the work done quickly and correctly. Then each of us took a dialer and built in the skilling templates.
                        I then spent the rest of my evening updating the playbook, which is an excel book that contains all the workgroups, services, templates and other pertinent information about the line of business.

                    <h3>Home Depot Remediation</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was asked to head a brand new project to remediate income for Home Depot. This was in conjunction with the QA department who would upload accounts to a Sharepoint. I would contact the customer, verify their income and update their credit card account accordingly. 
                        Due to FCC violations made previously, this had to be done within 48 hours of receiving and by a specialist. Due to the amount of work, I trained 5 additional agents to assist with the work. We worked with Sharepoint and multiple in house systems, along with following 
                        multple FCC scripts and procedures.
